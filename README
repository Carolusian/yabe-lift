I found playframework use yabe as its tutorial application. It is quite helpful for beginner who want to study playframework.

For me, liftweb's comet feature is very attractive. This is the reason that I want to learn liftweb.

Currently, the documentation of liftweb is a mass. So I want to do a tutorial about how to implement yabe in liftweb.

Here is the source code about the application. I am going to start to write the tutorial later.
